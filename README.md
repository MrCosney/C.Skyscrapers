# BREAF INSTRUCTION

Dear **Evaluator**, please note that my program solve any size since to **_2x2 - 6x6_** included in normal time ~20 sec. 

6x6 - 9x9 temporarily off because of long computation time. **_BUT IT CAN SOLVE IT!_**

If you want to check it and you have a really good patience:

Remove or comment folow part from **_main.c_**

# UPDATES
24.04 It's kind of late first update, cause I have a trouble with my internet connection ..ooops 2020
Now I found the solution for any size of board till 9x9 but it kinda take a lot of computation time, and I don't use the big While 
structure, only recursion.
